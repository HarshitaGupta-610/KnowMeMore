A modern, responsive, and interactive portfolio showcasing my projects, achievements, skills, and journey as a Computer Science & AI student.

This portfolio is designed to be a dynamic digital identity — clean UI, fully responsive, project-centric, and built to evolve as I grow in tech.
It highlights my work in web development, AI/ML, full-stack projects, hackathons, and internships.
